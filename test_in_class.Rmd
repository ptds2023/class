## R Markdown
### Some smaller title

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** *Knit* ***Knit*** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=TRUE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Here is the mean of the dataset `cars` `r mean(cars[,1])`.

Some list:   

* item 1   
- item 2   
+ item 3

Some ordered list:

1. order 1
1. order 2
1. order 3
